- fix json parsers to accept new keys without exiting with an error,
  they should just print a warning and support new objects of
  any depth.
- fix tests to run without mydns
- make tests that actually talk to DynamoDB
- rename the aws_handle structure to aws_dynamo_handle for sanity.
- look at x-amz-crc32 header in response and use it to verify response integrity,
  could use zlib for crc32
- add support for remaining DynamoDB operations: BatchWriteItem,
  DeleteItem, DeleteTable, DescribeTable, ListTables, UpdateTable
- turn Errx, Warn, Debug macros into methods that save an error message or id that
  can be retrieved by the application
- Change aws.c:base64_encode() to not use open_memstream() since open_memstream()
  isn't portable.  Instead, use an openssl mem buffer, see BIO_s_mem(3) for details.
- extract x-amzn-RequestId header and include it in error messages
- add support for B (Binary) and BS (Binary Set) types
- add support for DynamoDB v2
- update to signature v4 (I think with that we can stop using the
  session token service)
